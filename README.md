## How to modify the image size and position

You need to modify the line `60` on the `template.xml` file.

```xml
<Image id="art" x="0" y="125" width="3288" height="4488" url="${image_uris.art_crop}">
```

Move your image horizontally `x` and verticaly `y` and see what's the best result for you. You can also change the `width` and the `height` to adjust your image position. Note that the maximum you can go is `3288x4488`.

This is an example on why to change those values could be useful. I personnally prefer the *y="300"* one.

| y="0" | y="125" | y="300" |

## How to use the back template for Power/Toughness

The Power/Thoughness (pt) template for the back side of the cards is not used by default. In the `/pt` folder you can find the default front side pt templates. If you want to use the pt templates for the back side you will need to replace the files in the `/pt` folder with the files in the `/pt/back` folder (I sudgest you to save the default files somewhere).
